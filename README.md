# Recipes website  
## What is this?    

A work in progress recipe website. I took inspiration from [a freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://youtu.be/-8LTPIJBGwQ) but I gave it a more personal interpretation. My main objective is to build a simple but very user-friendly website.     

## Which language did I use?    

At first it was only HTML and CSS. Now I'm gradually adding functionality with JS as I learn it.
